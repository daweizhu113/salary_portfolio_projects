Salary prediction project

This is a school project asking to examine a set of job postings with salaries and then predict salaries for any new sets of job postings.

Data:
There are 3 dataset csv files: training_features, train_salaries and test_features
  train_features.csv: Each row represents an individual job posting.
  train_salaries.csv: Each row associates a “jobId” with a “salary”.
  test_features.csv: Similar to train_features.csv, each row represents an individual job posting.
  
Objectives:
  Build a model to predict the salaries for the job posting contained in the test_feature.csv and the output should also be a csv file 
  entitled with test_salaries.csv where each row has 2 attributes: jobId, salary
  
Deliverables:
The following deliverables must be submitted:
  Your test_salaries.csv file containing the salary predictions for the test data set (.zip, .7z, or .gz compression is allowed).
  The code that you wrote to solve the problem (.zip, .7z, or .gz compression is allowed).
